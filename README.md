# Computer-aided Dispatch Application

This is a computer-aided dispatch application, designed to be used by an experienced and trained dispatcher.
It is not a replacement for a trained dispatcher, but rather a tool to help them do their job.

We have many of these, but they are all proprietary and closed-source. This is an attempt to create an
open-source version. It is not intended to be a complete replacement for any of the existing systems, but
rather an alternative or inspiration.

This application is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), using [Ktor](https://ktor.io) framework.
It is designed to be used on a desktop computer, but can also be used on a mobile device.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to be a realistic simulation of a dispatch center. It is not intended to
replace, or even be a complete replacement for, any existing dispatch center. It is intended to be a
method for FiveM server owners to create a realistic dispatch center, and to allow their dispatchers to
experience and train for possible real-world cases.

This application can be fully modified by government agencies, and can be used to train dispatchers for
any situation. It is not exclusive to FiveM.

## Planned Features

- Realistic simulation of a dispatch center
- Realistic callouts (with the ability to add more, or disable for use in FiveM)
- Realistic callout responses (with the ability to add more, or disable for use in FiveM)
- Built-in callout editor
- Built-in callout response editor
- Built-in callout and callout response documentation
- Built-in callout and callout response testing
- Beautiful UI with a dark theme
- UI has the ability to add GPS coordinates to the map and track units locations.
- Assign units to callouts
- Callout Details
- Callout History
